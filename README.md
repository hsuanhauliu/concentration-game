# Concentration Game App
A simple two-player concentration game on iOS built while I was following along [Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316) tutorial on iTunes U. In addition to what was taught in the tutorial, I added more features such as multi-player, turn tracking, and game reset.
